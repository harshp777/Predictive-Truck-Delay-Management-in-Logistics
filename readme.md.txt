Feature Store :A feature store is a central repository for storing, sharing, and managing machine learning features. 
Features are individual measurable properties or characteristics used in predictive models.
The primary purpose of a feature store is to ensure that features used during model training are consistent with those used during
 model serving, thereby enhancing reproducibility and reducing discrepancies between offline training and online inference.
